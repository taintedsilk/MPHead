throw the files in net7.0 into customlibs (idk how to make it more clean)

and run the python mplocal.py file (you have to install python (MUST CHOOSE ADD TO PATH OPTION) and run "pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy" in cmd

work as is BUT accuracy will very likely be low

Mostly for personal use...

THE LOGICS ARE IN MPLOCAL.PY
